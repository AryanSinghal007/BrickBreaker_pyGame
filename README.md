# BrickBreaker_pyGame
I developed a Brick Breaker game using Pygame module for the game mechanics and incorporated a GUI using the Tkinter module.

## Start Up Window

With the help of tkinter, I have designed a welcoming window that prompts the user to input their name and select the desired level of play. Additionally, I have implemented a mechanism to record the highest score achieved by a player by storing the maximum score in a JSON file.


## The Game

Utilizing the pygame module, I orchestrated the entire sequence of events within the game. In accordance with our established system, the next time a user participates, the new high score for the specified level will be set. To enhance the thrill and excitement of the game, I introduced an exciting new feature that dynamically increases the speed of the ball as the user progresses through each level. This adds an element of challenge and keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.
